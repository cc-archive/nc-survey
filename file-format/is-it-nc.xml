	    at the direction of the allowable NC user, may exercise a
	    right licensed under the Creative Commons license.

	    Money may change hands in connection with the use of an

	  </title>
	  <option onselect="Your intended use does not qualify">
	    As a condition of using the NC-licensed work
	  </option>
	  <option onselect="Your intended use does not qualify">
	    As a condition of using another work that includes an
	    NC-licensed work, where the NC-licensed work is either
	    the primary draw or a substantial amount (whether
	    qualitatively or quantitatively) of the primary draw
	  </option>
	  <!-- check with Mia --> 	    <option>
	    As a condition of using
	    another work that includes a verbatim NC-licensed work,
	    where the NC-licensed work is not the primary draw or is
	    an insubstantial amount, both qualitatively and
	    quantitatively, as long as there is no charge for
	    accessing the NC-licensed work
	  </option>
	  <!-- check with Mia --> <option>
	    As an optional contribution (e.g., a tip jar, donations,
	    membership drive) for an allowed NC user (diverges from
	    PDF!) that uses the verbatim NC-licensed work or another
	    work that includes a verbatim NC-licensed work
